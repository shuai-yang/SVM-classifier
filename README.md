# SVM-classifier
we will use Scikit-learn, a Python framework for machine learning, for creating our SVM classifier.
 step-by-step example of how to generate a sample dataset, build the SVM classifier, train it, and visualize the decision boundary that has emerged after training
 
  classifying new samples according to a preexisting set of decision criteria.
  
  binary classification scenario.
