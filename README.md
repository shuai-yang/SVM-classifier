# SVM-classifier
This is step-by-step a practice to create a simple SVM classifier for a binary classification scenario using Scikit-learn.
## Steps
### (1) Generating a dataset

### (2) Building the SVM classifier
- Choosing a kernel function <br/>
- Fitting training data to the classifier <br/>
### (3) Using SVM to predict new data samples
- Predicting new data samples
- Evaluate the classifier with the test set. In this case, we did so by means of a **confusion matrix**, which shows us the correct and wrong predictions in terms of **true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives**<br/>

### (4) Finding the support vectors of your trained SVM: as we know, support vectors determine the decision boundary. But given your training data, which vectors were used as a support vector? We can find out – and we will show you.
(4) Visualizing the decision boundary: by means of a cool extension called Mlxtend, we can visualize the decision boundary of our model. We’re going to show you how to do this with your binary SVM classifier.
