#USER# None at all. Just the ability to lie and adore total corruption. #USER# Actually most seem to be communists which as they are elected by the population probably means much of the USA is now communist. #USER# Spot on. They'd both bare their arses on Holywood Boulevard if the price was right and there was exclusive air travel involved. #USER# With your media and government the very talk of having friends is somewhat naieve. #USER# If there is a God, God willing he will do no such thing. #USER# #USER# Surely a careless injection is not going to be blamed on covid is it? Is it? RT #USER#: I'm shocked, I tell you, shocked! 😱 #URL# #USER# With an appointment taking 3 weeks I doubt he would have remembered your other visits. #USER# I saw a tv advert with a white person in it the other day. I felt ashamed and took three knees. #USER# Wow, not only are you a fantastic artist you're a critic as well. Wouldn't you better spend your time looking for work? #USER# Piss off you remaining moron. We've left. Having difficulty to venting your bile. Get lost moron. #USER# Fine, let's breed British Nationals then. Much better than bringing in many who will remain unemployed. Out of the mouths of babes (oft times come gems) . #URL# #USER# What a corrupt, moronic verbose cow she is. What a wonderful future she would have with the BBC #USER# #USER# Agree with you. Its outrageous and just a plaything for minor celebs and broadcasters. #USER# No sense at all. . . . . he hasn't got that much . . . . #USER# Agree but I only agree entirely. 100% . . . . . #USER# #USER# Yes and further, you must be prepared to serve in half pint glasses as well as pint glasses. #USER# #USER# For Wailing read wanking. #USER# #USER# Air time. . . . . . they shouldn't be given air !!! #USER# Pondering to the .000001% I suspect. #USER# And a British passport with full residency. Whatever Scotland wants is up to her people but with Krankie and her SNP, Scotland won't find membership of the 3rd world let alone the EU. #USER# Twitters has tens of thousands of flakes sweetie . . . . . #USER# Half in and out like Norway. The primary difference being they yodel. #USER# #USER# Hammer, Nail, Head ! #URL# Think I'll give the genetic engineering a miss. . . .

Try throw or hurl. . . . . #USER# #USER# Even then he wouldn't remember. #USER# #USER# Damn it. You're dead right. Leave her be to wreck the Union. #USER# #USER# Not as good as this one 💋💋💋💋💋💋 #URL# #USER# Agreed but its like watching paint dry the speed at which it moves. Its terrible. #USER# #USER# With his fathers help it is conceivable he could have done a better job. #USER# Jesus wept that's frightening. How does he get on with toilet paper? Don't object to a single word of this because its all so painfully true. #URL# RT #USER#: Every picture tells a story 🇬🇧🇺🇸🙏 #URL# #USER# Yourself. What else could possibly interest you. #USER# Classy woman. She can't spell "their" but she's an expert on the dangers of Covid vaccines. 👎 #USER# #USER# Sue the bastards. Clearly its a libel. From the mouths of babes . . . . . . . . . #URL# #USER# Many a true word but perhaps none as true as this . . . . . #USER# Agree with everything written. Italy or France. Which country do you think will leave the EU first ? #USER# Don't know but she seems happy enough. . . . . #USER# If we don't get the massive snow drifts we are being threatened with every day it will soon be summer. I see Bojo is planning another reduction of army numbers. Now let me see . . . . two minus one is . . . . . . #USER# After the trouncing the EU gave Johnson I suspect he'll be more than aware that Biden really could make his eyes water. Was Prince Harry right to brand US Capitol Hill riots 'violent extremism'? #URL# #USER# The Germans eat Spinach piled on mashed potato with a couple of fried eggs on top. It really is dreadful. #USER# #USER# And no one did jack shit about anything. You can expect some real rough handling at the hands of democrats now. #USER# Should have sat in his truck and pissed himself. #USER# Dear God, how much per annum does the arsehole who approved this outrage earn? #USER# Canada has pretty tough restrictions on hand guns and sawn off shotguns etc but hunting rifles are still permitted. #USER# 50 out of 10 for this one. Frankly I doubt if even Carlsberg could make a miserable tosser like this one. #USER# Probably not trying to kill off or reduce their population. They'll do this by shooting them when the time is right. #USER# #USER# It was quite nice in a funny way with marmite on it. #USER# Try to enjoy them Andy. . . . . .they won't let me go on much longer. In fact, without followers I can't . . . . . . #USER# Yes sir. Jonte. Isn't it good to read something like this. Won't be long before Comrade twatter takes this down. #URL# #USER# Don't be silly he got far more than that and if you take into account Mars and Venus then you can add even more. #USER# I think you are right. I suspect they will do far better than even you would have believed. #USER# #USER# Not true, Soros would have done as normal and sent the ring leaders their $15 dollars per hour rewards- This tweet had 540 likes but now for some reason or other has dropped to under 60. I can't believe tripe like this rattles them. #USER# #USER# You mean genetic engineering injections don't you. These are not vaccinations as such. #USER# #USER# You don't have enough years left to wait for that lady. #USER# Twitter has lost 5 billion from its share value. An alarming figure until you realise it's only 5%. . . . . . . !!! #USER# Congratulations. apart from making yourself an arsehole by your crass naive remarks you have achieved nothing. #USER# If they are going to wear stab vests wouldn't it be better if they wore some that fitted them. #USER# Cyril Smith could have outrun that lot. Are the police not better able to serve us if they are fit? #USER# Yes he has. He's lied to us yet again. and didn't he do it well. We were all fooled. #USER# Have a look in the mainstream media. Should Scotland receive compensation for Brexit? #URL# #USER# When you look at the history of SNP leadership it really does seem to be a case of one way or another you will be screwed. #USER# I used to say the same thing about my horse. . . . #USER# He has FBPE after his name so he must be a fucking idiot !! #USER# No I don't. I just know what they say and threaten. #USER# Edge is Microsoft. Chrome is Google. When did this remarkable happening come about ? #USER# #USER# I think it was Serco yes. #USER# Yes she contracted with a UK company to provide service etc for incoming refugees for the next ten years. #USER# I think they get theirs before departure. . . . . . #USER# #USER# A lot of people in hell will be very unhappy if he is granted entry rights. #USER# Because I am honest I have to tell you that I am not honest. . . . . #USER# With Biden about to enter the white house I'm not sure you can ever again refer to a safe American home. . . . . #USER# It is. It's very worrying. It also explains why the names of those who refuse the vaccination will be held. Anyone know what the situation is with state aid. Its seems to be very quiet in that department. #USER# #USER# What is it that the fools can't see. Tell us. We might be able to avoid it. Is this really the shape of things to come. Its a frighteningly compelling argument with logic based observations. #URL# #USER# Been a long time since there has been anything to joke about in this country. #USER# I suppose what is meant is that they can cancel the trade deal. #USER# With this agreement I can't see that we've got it. #USER# Anything which gives us genuine departure from the EU and this agreement is tying us in everywhere. #USER# What a terribly interesting tweet. It's made my Christmas. . . . . . . #USER# Yes and they will be led by that gap toothed festering pile of shite who never misses an opportunity to put the boot into Britain. #USER# Can you imagine a super tanker going out of control and crashing into a bridge support. . . . . . . #USER# Putting links in sucks up words. Links can take 2 lines. Do your own research Diane. #USER# #USER# Put it in the over at 200c and it will be quite happy to leave. #USER# Oh a subversive f*cker are we. . . . . . . . !!! #USER# I suppose so although I think you are far too generous with your description. #USER# #USER# They do but they don't send it until its been paid for. . . . . . . #USER# Its in today's Daily Express which I agree is not a bastion of truth but sometimes they make a mistake and tell the truth. Numerous emails to them asking what the violations were went unanswered which is typical twitter. #USER# Lost of newspapers reporting this fake news David. Why do you say its fake? #USER# #USER# Nothing but the idiot is a libdung and failing to achieve is something they have always specialised in. . . . . Christ almighty. The country's full of lemmings. #USER# Its all on Google John #USER# #USER# No she doesn't. Read what she says. What's wrong with you wretched democrats? #USER# #USER# Better a benevolent dictator than a brutal globalist. Or do you have admiration for Lenin and his ilk? #USER# She should have kicked him viciously in the nuts to see his eyes bounce . . . . . . #USER# #USER# They're only doing that because he's black. #USER# Google the tweet content and you'll be taken straight to it. #USER# #USER# Ricky you shouldn't say that. And I shouldn't agree with you ! #USER# #USER# #USER# Silly Billy. Only white people can be deported !!! #USER# Kids who don't go to school in Scotland do better than those who do. #USER# Oh you cynic . . . . . #USER# Sorry, left the address off. #URL# #USER# If you get your door kicked in at 3 a.m. tomorrow morning by the fuzz, you'll have your answer. #USER# No, they're impressively high on the list of most drunks in the world. And there is more. Emmanuel Macron tests positive for Covid-19 and is self-isolating #URL# via #USER# Nothing trivial I trust. #USER# #USER# Maybe but when it comes to politics an awful lot do . . . #USER# Obviously under the influence of her previous husband whose ribs she broke when inadvertently rolling on him during one night. #USER# Oh dear, the bit with Clinton and Obama is quite distressing. You really would be taking a great risk. #USER# Its worse. Whilst being as equally fatal, Shipman never insulted his patients like the EU insult us. #USER# Oh no, not that old rocking horse shite on the moon quote. . . . . . !! #USER# #USER# Which part of Richard's tweet generated all this hysteria Liam ? #USER# Which part is the wishful thinking ??? #USER# Mainly from Twitter in constantly repeated tweets. Google does tend to confirm them tho as you will see if you do a simple search. #USER# #USER# Improved a lot since I last saw it. SNP really are bringing home the bacon. . . . . . . OMG ! #USER# #USER# Bit on the tanned side for Anne Boleyn. #USER# Senility. . . . what a dreadful end to such a productive life. . . . . #USER# #USER# Most of the abuse comes from twitter itself. Boris says he won't allow any red lines to be crossed and he has the permission of the EU to say it. #USER# None so blind as those who cannot, will not and must not see. Such people end up as gofors for the democrats. #USER# You would expect that from a strong moral person but perhaps we don't have one of those working for us. #USER# #USER# Difficult to argue with that and if there were any justice there would be a very close draw. RT #USER#: #USER# Especially after all the millions already given to them to patrol their own beaches for illegals. #USER# World of Suzy Wong. Probably because I was stationed in Hong Kong for a while and knew it well. #USER# Oh please Adam. You're speaking as if YouTube is owned by Google . . . . . #USER# Not much use if they step ashore and go straight for a benefits office is it. . . . . . . #USER# Me too but in fairness she doesn't seem to be too bright. #USER# #USER# In real terms that would be correct because sure as hell that's what killed him. Increasingly the SNP look more like a party of subversion and treason than a political party appointed by a reasonable people. #USER# Yes but stealing fish is cheaper. OK people, one last poll . . . . . Is Boris going to go for no deal or will he capitulate at the last moment ? #USER# Damn it, forgot that but its very true . . . . . #USER# I think that as well. Its a small world and bad things travel very quickly. #USER# Its all in Google including travel agents who can get you there cheaply. If the USA decided it had to fight for its democracy would it be illegal if people from this country went to help? #USER# All of them ! #USER# #USER# I thought that was the intention all the time and when it happens America is going to hurt and hurt badly. #USER# It's pissed me off dozens of times. #USER# I don't think its a case of it being swallowed but rather a case of it being rammed down our throats. Can anyone in the USA tell us here in Britain what the accurate situation is with President Trump and the rigged USA election ? #USER# Its OK - Bill Gates said there was no need for trials. . . . . . . . . . . . and as a Bilderberger he should know !!! #USER# More importantly Ann we need to know what its going to do for us and to us. #USER# #USER# Which tory ????????????????????????????????????? #USER# As he's all wind you are probably dead right. #USER# #USER# She's had so many facelifts she now shaves twice per day. . . . . #USER# What was right? #USER# Got a chip on your shoulder sweetie ? This is Britain, it's not necessary. You shut up. #USER# #USER# My wife has left me because of my insecurities. No wait, she's back. She just went to make a cup of tea #USER# What about peace with Israel Joe? What point are you making. The peace seems to be spreading to among Arab states. #USER# Not so sure with the amount of bent US judges. #USER# God will be so impressed. No opinion. . . .you decide. #URL# Biden vote fraud claims hit ONE MILLION in five key states, independent investigator says #URL# My wife has left me because of my insecurities. No wait, she's back. She just went to make a cup of tea! #USER# As far as I am concerned even paying them nothing would be too much. #USER# No Muslims. Must have been about 1710. #USER# Covid . . . . #URL# Covid. Look at this video and then ask yourself if you want to be vaccinated against it.#URL# #USER# #USER# Put it back in your pants. You'll go blind. #USER# Nothing, why do you think it has? #USER# Yes but it was only a little stab. Stop making mountains out of molehills . . . . . . . #USER# Now the roads will be full of people who never learned to drive properly and won't be insured. Not only democracy has lost. #USER# Oh dear Hamilton will be confused. #USER# #USER# Don't forget his perks, expenses and bungs. . . . . . #USER# Re your profile. . . . .not sure whether honesty is liked by the public. Most of them have never experienced it. I gave no source for this story so here it is again. #URL# #USER# #USER# Daily Express today.

Antifa and BLM now officially have their "get out of jail free" card courtesy of the White House. #USER# They "won" and they can't enjoy it. They want more. they want blood. They're never f***ing satisfied. Garth Brooks should be ashamed of himself. The dumb*ss should've sang, 'I've got friends in low places....." Disgusting. #USER# This election was never about Biden. Ever. He’s a footnote at best. #USER# #USER# Being civil to them will get you nothing. They hate all of us and nothing will deter them from silencing us. #USER# It will hurt everyone except illegals and politicians. #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# Glad I’m no longer a Republican. These idiots are a disgrace. #USER# F***ing Democrats. That’s what they are. #USER# #USER# Trump should have fired this loser. #USER# #USER# It’s why the GOP is a dead party. The Whigs will get more votes in 2022. Figures. But the media will never report it. #URL# #USER# Since they are all Dems (the FBI is making sure of that), I wonder if they even have guns? #USER# #USER# He will get to the bottom of nothing. He talks but does nothing. Ever. Screw you, Lindsey. #USER# #USER# #USER# Rove is just another Bushie globalist. He always hated Trump. #USER# #USER# Mitch is a disgrace. Ditch Mitch. #USER# #USER# Why does anyone even listen to this cretin? #USER# #USER# #USER# They don’t realize that millions of us are already gone. The GOP is an empty shell. RT #USER#: I wish this picture of Joe Biden holding hands with the leader of the KKK would go viral #URL# #USER# #USER# Duh. The GOP is the modern day Titanic and McConnell is Captain Smith. It’s all but sunk. #USER# #USER# Check the Antifa membership list, you morons! #USER# #USER# That’s kind of you, however, bailing out businesses that will never survive the lockdowns is a wasted effort. #USER# Turn the boats around or sink them and jail the illegal aliens. #USER# These traitors have the same future as the GOP does. Zero. #USER# She doesn't represent the voters. She represents the majority of establishment hacks that still actually run the GOP. #USER# She has always been a vicious snake in a skirt. Anger fueled by a mixture of vodka and Prozac. #USER# #USER# Vodka mixed with her Prozac probably. #USER# #USER# Which means that the Muslim Brotherhood is actually pulling the strings. #USER# #USER# Bye bye Fox. No one cares anymore. #USER# Roll Tide despite the bad refs and BS targeting calls! #USER# What? You people have spent four years trying to overthrow my president!! Targeting? AYFKM? Total bullsh** College football refs suck. Roll Tide. I’ve gotta say. Pelosi looks much better in a mask. #USER# #USER# Sink the damn boats! #USER# Well that pretty much eliminates 99% of the elected Republicans in Minnesota. #USER# How can anyone defeat them when they control all of the voting machines?????? #USER# #USER# #USER# Gotta admit that I feel the same. Never this say it. #USER# #USER# It’s an all out assault on conservatives. #USER# #USER# Romney’s puppet and spy. From this day on, all GOP fundraising letters that I get will be marked “Return to Sender” with a big bold Sharpie!! #USER# #USER# #USER# The GOP cowards will be getting all their fundraising requests back in mail marked “Return to Sender”!! #USER# Deep State bullsh** #USER# Because you’re afraid of the media.... #USER# Which was Ryan and McConnell’s project. #USER# Be safe. I will always stand with Pres Trump. Honestly, the fact that there is even a question about what Mike Pence will do today speaks volumes about the backbone of Republicans. #USER# #USER# #USER# Why should there even be a question of whether Pence will come through? #USER# This is GOP's last chance to survive as a political party. If they fail today, they can just close the doors. #USER# Are they going to allow you time to do it? Do you guys have all the evidence? #USER# I'd say that is on the money. #USER# Probably never. Sad. #USER# They won’t be done counting for 48 hours. No one will be in the senate from Georgia tomorrow. #USER# Looks like about time for a pipe to bust so they can stop counting until the trucks come with more fake Dem ballots. #USER# #USER# The guy never heard of a disguise? #USER# #USER# Why should we be surprised? They got away with it two months ago. Why would they stop? #USER# Sadly, Ann has lost her marbles. #USER# Swine. The swamp is in every state and not just in DC. #USER# And those two just slinked away quietly. How much were they paid? #USER# The GOP in Georgia had two months to prevent fraud and they chose to do nothing. Fools. #USER# #USER# Yes, Captain Ramius. #USER# Correct. But we will never get term limits except by a convention of the states. #USER# I told you guys. What do you expect? The Georgia GOP did nothing since November to prevent the fraud from being repeated! Fools! #USER# That's not as hard as keeping her away from a buffet. #USER# And we need their votes counted correctly! #USER# Fox News has its puppets like Brian K urging Trump to concede because "there is no evidence" of vote fraud. Unbelievable! #USER# #USER# Demolish it and make a parking lot. #USER# So what ever happened to the legislature revoking his “emergency” tyranny powers? #USER# Now we will see if there are any honest judges.....good luck with that. #USER# Maybe Trump wants them to hear and see for themselves. #USER# #USER# If only he'd fired those jackasses a year ago. Maybe things would be different.... #USER# Is he afraid that she will sit on him? #USER# #USER# #USER# Purge the RINOs! If the GOP is not a conservative party, it is a USELESS party! #USER# Turn Nadler and Stacy Abrams loose and they could demolish the biggest buffet on earth. #USER# Why the hell is anyone talking about who is running in 2024? #USER# #USER# #USER# He sure did. That guy changed into an establishment hack when we ran with Romney in 2012. #USER# What do you have to hide? Or you just scared of the establishment? #USER# #USER# Pretty much says it. They are "comfortable losers." #USER# #USER# I presume that you and your fellow GOP members are NOT going to comply. Right??? #USER# #USER# Who? I thought Mpls abolished the PD??? #USER# #USER# And the weak GOP, led by Doubt, will go right along with it.... #USER# #USER# Despite the fact that Crazy Bernie got screwed again in the Democrat primaries. Is it just me or does Stacy Abrams look like she swallowed Oprah? #USER# The Jihad Squad. #USER# Did Ocrazyo-Cortez have some plastic surgery on her body? Just axing.... #USER# It’s actually a bigger fraud than Obama convincing people that he was an American citizen. #USER# First, you’re a nobody. Second, you’re a Democrat. Run in the correct party, you A-hole. #USER# That guy was a jackoff in 2016 and he still is. Pay him no attention. #USER# I pray that is true. #USER# #USER# 17% more than Obama and 24% more than Crooked Hillary? No f***ing way. #USER# In the end, the Dems stick together and we always have Rino traitors. #USER# But you can’t sell it because nobody wants to live in sh**hole NY. Too bad. #USER# Biden hasn’t been elected! #USER# You’re not a Republican! #USER# Stand up for our president!!!!! #USER# Whiners. They think we are stupid. #USER# #USER# It’s been that way for years. People are just seeing it. #USER# #USER# They’re in on it! #USER# Yes! I see another national championship! #USER# How about we don’t spend the tax money at all??? #USER# #USER# #USER# I told you people that McConnell should’ve been replaced! #USER# #USER# They won’t work? Fire them all!! #USER# Teachers should not be allowed to strike. Overpaid, under worked union thugs is what they are. #USER# Don’t forget that many citizens will get nothing due to the income limits! #USER# I feel sorry for people who don’t drink. When they get up in the morning, that’s as good as they feel all day.... #USER# Because they cannot buy him or control him. That’s why the establishment hates our president! #USER# We will see on Jan. 6.... #USER# They should tell the left to f*** off and keep campaigning. #USER# Charles, he works for the establishment and the Dems. #USER# #USER# Lots of people will not get it due to the income limits. #USER# And this ex-Deep state hack is qualified to attack a senator why? #USER# #USER# She wants to get poked on national tv? Exhibitionist.... #USER# #USER# Don’t give advice to someone that is 1,000 times the man you are. Just shut up and go away. #USER# No! Test people that are sick. Stop testing healthy people just so that you can claim more “cases” and shut things down!! #USER# #USER# Or is the testing that has produced more “cases” than ever just plain faulty?? #USER# He has always been a full RINO. The rest was just an act. Just like Lindsey's act. #USER# Big Social Media hates it when they cannot control us. #USER# I've been telling you guys this for years. #USER# Not enough if these cowardly so-called conservative judges will not step up and restore the integrity of our elections. #USER# He takes his orders from the DC establishment. It's that simple. That squirrel should've been replaced by Trump on Day One. #USER# #USER# She appears to be headed to another buffet at Golden Corral. #USER# He's not a failure. He has been doing exactly what the establishment has told him to do. #USER# They are essential to the Democrat Party. #USER# He is working for the establishment. Always has been. #USER# I said that in 2014. I still regret those two votes. Damn. #USER# Dumbed down losers. #USER# What the Founding Fathers would DO is important. They wouldn’t just talk about it. #USER# They’re just waiting for the next email from Soros with new instructions. #USER# But there is no gang problem.... #USER# That’s a disgrace. Whatever happened to the good old USA?

No vagina, male socialization, nothing in common with women. #HASHTAG# Trans women are oppressed because of homophobia, not because of misogyny. Women aren't punished for wearing dresses, men are. #HASHTAG# Men aren't murdering trans women because they're listening to too much radical feminism. #HASHTAG# that's because we've seen people change their "gender identity" on a dime and then change it again every other week #HASHTAG# Feminism is never about blaming women, for performing gender roles or anything else. Feminism is about blaming the system. #HASHTAG# Feminism isn't about blaming women for transing, doing porn, etc. It's about blaming men for the system that supports it. #HASHTAG# Patriarchy happened because of agriculture, actually. Owning people and land. It came with slavery. #HASHTAG# The discrimination that trans women face is homophobia, Laci, not misogyny. It's men judging men. A different issue. #HASHTAG# will people always make generalizations about race, Laci, and is that ok? RT #USER#: #USER# #USER# Did you just assume there were only 96 genders?

Radical feminism is about females, which is male exclusionary, not trans-exclusionary. #USER# #USER# Yeah, it's called misogyny. In this case, internalized by a woman. Sigh, patriarchy wins this round Another misogynist who doesn't understand class theory #URL# #USER# And demanding sex from anyone for any reason is called rape culture. #USER# Good theory but in reality they aren't called anything.

Not trying to be mean, but someone needs to say it. I'd worry abt regrets #USER# #USER# Yes, all those johns that beat up transwomen are clearly reading too much Dworkin Women who don't date transwomen = human rights crisis. Men who don't date transwomen = nothing to see here. That's misogyny. TERF is a word invented for females, like feminazi. Saying there are male TERFs is like saying there are white n**** : you're still a bigot. Word for lesbians who don't date transwomen=TERF. Word for straight men who don't date transwomen=normal.

Men's rights activism got a real boost of cred when it decided to start wearing dresses. #USER# Keep kissing male ass. You can do that without worrying about me. Patriarchy's ass kissers are boring me. #USER# Yes I'm aware that that's how you've defined yourself. Dudes can't stop hating feminists, no matter what they wear.

Yawn. #USER# Ah never mind you're a dude, lol. Makes sense now. Men love to mansplain feminism to females. #USER# Keep kissing male ass if you must dear, but don't worry yourself about those of us who center females. FEMALE is a biological term, not a social one like "woman." Notice the word feminism isn't "womanism" -- maybe THAT'S the movement you want When the most controversial statement of our time is a tautology. #URL# #USER# #USER# Your video's too long and your tweets make no sense.

Transgenderism is conservative, not liberal. #URL# A macho dick is the only worthy dick, right republicans and transgenderists? Patriarchy finds the genitals of women &amp; nonconformists problematic and wants them mutilated: FGM, transgender surgery, cosmetic labiaplasty #USER# Google searches lead to articles, bro MtFs are flippant about FGM b/c they're interested in genital mutilation for themselves &amp; others. Drawing that line = cognitive dissonance. #USER# You're motivated to push genital mutilation and transing of kids, so of course you don't take FGM seriously. #USER# Yes, they do, as a quick google search will reveal. And only misogynists brush away FGM to promote other agendas. #USER# Agreed. Getting a thrill off a pair of panties is probably great fun! But it does not make you a woman. 1 more parting Easter message to trans activists. Remember, saying bunnies have cottontails doesn't mean bunnies are one big cottontail! That's all I have time for for tonight, but trans activists can google "valid logical reasoning" for more help on this really simple matter Here's another helpful link for trans activists! #URL# Now maybe they can move past the idea of walking, talking vaginas! I think trans activists are just *pretending* to not know this basic logic, but either way it's pretty embarrasing #URL# It's really pretty basic stuff. Just a quick look &amp; you'll learn that having a vagina doesn't MAKE you a vagina! #URL# For example, trans activists, having legs is necessary to being a cat, but other things are necessary too #URL# Here's another thing that might help trans activists: there's a difference between necessary and sufficient: #URL# Maybe this'll help trans activists: #URL# . All dogs are mammals, but not all mammals are dogs. Trans activist logic: People who say that cheetahs have spots are reducing cheetahs to one big giant spot lol Trans activist logic: People who say that trees have leaves are reducing trees to one big giant leaf lol Trans activist logic: People who say that birds have beaks are reducing birds to one big giant beak lol RT #USER#: ICYMI Thought police have stopped the airing of "Transgender KIds: Who Knows Best" #USER# Film is archived here RT #USER#: Turns out #USER# offended mothers with their #HASHTAG# ad.

Remember, you can avoid real feminist activism forever by spending all your time correcting undesirable language nuances in women's speech!
