They just don’t. #USER# #USER# She’s too brave to fit in with the spineless GOP. Just for the record, I want Biden to FAIL. FAIL in all respects. If he succeeds in his plans, America is GONE. Crooked Joe promised us a long dark winter and that is exactly what we are going to get. Damn. Antifa and BLM now officially have their \"get out of jail free\" card courtesy of the White House. #USER# They \"won\" and they can't enjoy it. They want more. they want blood. They're never f***ing satisfied. Garth Brooks should be ashamed of himself. The dumb*ss should've sang, 'I've got friends in low places.....\" Disgusting. #USER# This election was never about Biden. Ever. He’s a footnote at best. #USER# #USER# Being civil to them will get you nothing.

He talks but does nothing. Ever. Screw you, Lindsey. #USER# #USER# #USER# Rove is just another Bushie globalist. He always hated Trump. #USER# #USER# Mitch is a disgrace. Ditch Mitch. #USER# #USER# Why does anyone even listen to this cretin? #USER# #USER# #USER# They don’t realize that millions of us are already gone. The GOP is an empty shell. RT #USER#: I wish this picture of Joe Biden holding hands with the leader of the KKK would go viral #URL# #USER# #USER# Duh. The GOP is the modern day Titanic and McConnell is Captain Smith. It’s all but sunk. #USER# #USER# Check the Antifa membership list, you morons! #USER# #USER# That’s kind of you, however, bailing out businesses that will never survive the lockdowns is a wasted effort. #USER# Turn the boats around or sink them and jail the illegal aliens. #USER# These traitors have the same future as the GOP does. Zero. #USER# She doesn't represent the voters. She represents the majority of establishment hacks that still actually run the GOP. #USER# She has always been a vicious snake in a skirt.

No one cares anymore. #USER# Roll Tide despite the bad refs and BS targeting calls! #USER# What? You people have spent four years trying to overthrow my president!! Targeting? AYFKM?

I will always stand with Pres Trump. Honestly, the fact that there is even a question about what Mike Pence will do today speaks volumes about the backbone of Republicans. #USER# #USER# #USER# Why should there even be a question of whether Pence will come through? #USER# This is GOP's last chance to survive as a political party. If they fail today, they can just close the doors. #USER# Are they going to allow you time to do it? Do you guys have all the evidence? #USER# I'd say that is on the money. #USER# Probably never. Sad. #USER# They won’t be done counting for 48 hours. No one will be in the senate from Georgia tomorrow. #USER# Looks like about time for a pipe to bust so they can stop counting until the trucks come with more fake Dem ballots. #USER# #USER# The guy never heard of a disguise? #USER# #USER# Why should we be surprised? They got away with it two months ago. Why would they stop? #USER# Sadly, Ann has lost her marbles. #USER# Swine. The swamp is in every state and not just in DC. #USER# And those two just slinked away quietly. How much were they paid? #USER# The GOP in Georgia had two months to prevent fraud and they chose to do nothing. Fools. #USER# #USER# Yes, Captain Ramius. #USER# Correct. But we will never get term limits except by a convention of the states. #USER# I told you guys. What do you expect? The Georgia GOP did nothing since November to prevent the fraud from being repeated! Fools! #USER# That's not as hard as keeping her away from a buffet. #USER# And we need their votes counted correctly! #USER# Fox News has its puppets like Brian K urging Trump to concede because \"there is no evidence\" of vote fraud. Unbelievable! #USER# #USER# Demolish it and make a parking lot. #USER# So what ever happened to the legislature revoking his “emergency” tyranny powers? #USER# Now we will see if there are any honest judges.....good luck with that. #USER# Maybe Trump wants them to hear and see for themselves. #USER# #USER# If only he'd fired those jackasses a year ago. Maybe things would be different.... #USER# Is he afraid that she will sit on him? #USER# #USER# #USER# Purge the RINOs! If the GOP is not a conservative party, it is a USELESS party! #USER# Turn Nadler and Stacy Abrams loose and they could demolish the biggest buffet on earth. #USER# Why the hell is anyone talking about who is running in 2024? #USER# #USER# #USER# He sure did. That guy changed into an establishment hack when we ran with Romney in 2012. #USER# What do you have to hide? Or you just scared of the establishment? #USER# #USER# Pretty much says it. They are \"comfortable losers.\" #USER# #USER# I presume that you and your fellow GOP members are NOT going to comply. Right??? #USER# #USER# Who? I thought Mpls abolished the PD??? #USER# #USER# And the weak GOP, led by Doubt, will go right along with it.... #USER# #USER# Despite the fact that Crazy Bernie got screwed again in the Democrat primaries. Is it just me or does Stacy Abrams look like she swallowed Oprah? #USER# The Jihad Squad. #USER# Did Ocrazyo-Cortez have some plastic surgery on her body? Just axing.... #USER# It’s actually a bigger fraud than Obama convincing people that he was an American citizen. #USER# First, you’re a nobody. Second, you’re a Democrat. Run in the correct party, you A-hole. #USER# That guy was a jackoff in 2016 and he still is. Pay him no attention. #USER# I pray that is true. #USER# #USER# 17% more than Obama and 24% more than Crooked Hillary? No f***ing way. #USER# In the end, the Dems stick together and we always have Rino traitors. #USER# But you can’t sell it because nobody wants to live in sh**hole NY. Too bad. #USER# Biden hasn’t been elected! #USER# You’re not a Republican! #USER# Stand up for our president!!!!! #USER# Whiners. They think we are stupid. #USER# #USER# It’s been that way for years. People are just seeing it. #USER# #USER# They’re in on it! #USER# Yes! I see another national championship! #USER# How about we don’t spend the tax money at all??? #USER# #USER# #USER# I told you people that McConnell should’ve been replaced! #USER# #USER# They won’t work? Fire them all!! #USER# Teachers should not be allowed to strike. Overpaid, under worked union thugs is what they are. #USER# Don’t forget that many citizens will get nothing due to the income limits! #USER# I feel sorry for people who don’t drink. When they get up in the morning, that’s as good as they feel all day.... #USER# Because they cannot buy him or control him. That’s why the establishment hates our president! #USER# We will see on Jan. 6.... #USER# They should tell the left to f*** off and keep campaigning. #USER# Charles, he works for the establishment and the Dems. #USER# #USER# Lots of people will not get it due to the income limits. #USER# And this ex-Deep state hack is qualified to attack a senator why? #USER# #USER# She wants to get poked on national tv? Exhibitionist.... #USER# #USER# Don’t give advice to someone that is 1,000 times the man you are. Just shut up and go away. #USER# No! Test people that are sick. Stop testing healthy people just so that you can claim more “cases” and shut things down!! #USER# #USER# Or is the testing that has produced more “cases” than ever just plain faulty?? #USER# He has always been a full RINO. The rest was just an act. Just like Lindsey's act. #USER# Big Social Media hates it when they cannot control us. #USER# I've been telling you guys this for years. #USER# Not enough if these cowardly so-called conservative judges will not step up and restore the integrity of our elections. #USER# He takes his orders from the DC establishment. It's that simple. That squirrel should've been replaced by Trump on Day One. #USER# #USER# She appears to be headed to another buffet at Golden Corral. #USER# He's not a failure. He has been doing exactly what the establishment has told him to do. #USER# They are essential to the Democrat Party. #USER# He is working for the establishment.
